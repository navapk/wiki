## Day - 1

1. A computer network is a digital telecommnications network which allows nodes to share resources.
2. Nodes can be client, server, firewall, router switches etc.
3. A client is a device that accesses a service made available by a server.
4. A server is a device that provides functions or services for clients.
5. Switches:
    1. have many network interfaces/ports for end hosts to connect to (24+).
    2. provide connectivity to hosts within the same LAN (local area network).
    3. do not provide connectivity between LAN/s or over the internet.
6. Routers:
    1. have fewer network interfaces than switches.
    2. are used to provide connectivity between the LANs.
    3. are there used to send data over the internet.
7. Firewalls:
    1. monitor and control network traffic based on configured rules.
    2. can be placed inside the network or inside the network.
    3. are known as NGFW when they include more modern and advanced filtering capabilities.
8. Network firewalls are hardware devices that filter traffic between network.
9. Host-based firewalls are software applications that filter traffic entering and exiting a host machine, like a PC.

## Day - 2

1. Ethernet is a collection of network protocols/standards.
2. Speed is measured in _bits per second_ (Kbps, Mbps, Gbps), not bytes per second.
3. Ethernet standards are defined in IEE 802.3
4. Ethernet standards (copper):

| Speed   | Common Name      | IEEE Standard | Informal Name | Max length |
| 10Mbps  | Ethernet         | 802.3i        | 10BASE-T      | 100m       |
| 100Mbps | Fast Ethernet    | 802.3u        | 100BASE-T     | 100m       |
| 1Gbps   | Gigabit Ethernet | 802.3ab       | 1000BASE-T    | 100m       |
| 10Gbps  | 10Gig Ethernet   | 802.3an       | 10GBASE-T     | 100m       |
